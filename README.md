# Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning** techniques to detect plant diseases from images. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on a dataset of plant images to identify common plant diseases. The goal of this project is to provide farmers and gardeners with an easy-to-use tool to help diagnose plant diseases early, enabling better crop health management.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: The model classifies plant images into categories representing different plant diseases or healthy plants.
- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Users can upload plant images, and the model will predict whether the plant is diseased or healthy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple input and output system for easy use by non-technical users.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Programming Language**: Python
